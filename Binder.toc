## Interface: 110000, 110002
## Title: Binder
## Author: Tensigh
## Version: 2.9.0
## Notes: Addon that allows user to create Keybinding Profiles, for easy switching between different sets. Naming a profile after your Spec (e.g. Shadow) or Class-Spec (e.g. Priest-Holy) will auto apply that profile when you switch to that spec. Credit to github users jokaah and aza547 for adding that feature.
